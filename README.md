## Tested ##
On Ubuntu 22.04
## Dependencies ##
- Follow https://www.tecmint.com/install-chrome-ubuntu/ to install google-chrome-stable via apt
- sudo apt install chromium-chromedriver
## Caveat ##
Seems like user has to be logged in to execute chromedriver. This is a shame, makes automation bit tricky. Luckily I had other server from on which I have scheduled a job to remain logged into main server while token job runs
